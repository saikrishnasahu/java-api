The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation,
and deletion.
Java Collection means a single unit of objects.
Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque)
and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

What is Collection in Java
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

What is Collection framework
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
Algorithm

Hierarchy of Collection Framework

Iterable (I)
	Collection (I) - Store scalar(single) values
		List (I)
			ArrayList
			LinkedList
			Vector
				Stack
		Set (I)
			HashSet
			LinkedHashSet
			SortedSet (I)
				TreeSet                           Here I means Interface
		Queue (I)
			PriorityQueue
			Deque (I)
				ArrayDeque
				LinkedList
Map (I) - Store key value pairs
	HashTable
	HashMap
	LinkedHashMap
	SortedMap (I)
		TreeMap

Iterable Interface
The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes.
The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the subclasses of Collection interface
also implement the Iterable interface.

Collection Interface
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework.
It declares the methods that every collection will have.
In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.
Some of the methods of Collection interface are Boolean add ( Object obj),
Boolean addAll ( Collection c), void clear(), etc. which are implemented by all the subclasses of Collection interface.
