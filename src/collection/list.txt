List interface is the child interface of Collection interface.
It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects.
It can have duplicate values.
List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

ArrayList
The ArrayList class implements the List interface.
It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non-synchronized.
The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed

LinkedList
LinkedList implements the Collection interface.
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements.
It can store the duplicate elements.
It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized.
In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

Vector
Vector uses a dynamic array to store the data elements.
It is similar to ArrayList.It is synchronized and contains many methods that are not the part of Collection framework.

Stack
The stack is the subclass of Vector.
It implements the last-in-first-out data structure, i.e., Stack.
The stack contains all of the methods of Vector class and also provides its methods
like boolean push(), boolean peek(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.
