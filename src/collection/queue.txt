Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order.
It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed.
There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.

PriorityQueue
The PriorityQueue class implements the Queue interface.
It holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities.
PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue.

Deque Interface
Deque interface extends the Queue interface.
In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the side.
Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends.

ArrayDeque
ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface.
It facilitates us to use the Deque. Unlike queue, we can add or delete the elements from both the ends.
ArrayDeque is faster than ArrayList and Stack and has no capacity restrictions.
