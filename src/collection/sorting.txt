We can sort the elements of:
String objects
Wrapper class objects
User-defined class objects

Collections class provides static methods for sorting the elements of a collection.
If collection elements are of a Set type, we can use TreeSet.
However, we cannot sort the elements of List.
Collections class provides methods for sorting the elements of List type elements.

Note: String class and Wrapper classes implement the Comparable interface.
So if you store the objects of string or wrapper classes, it will be Comparable.

Comparable Interface
Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class.
This interface is found in java.lang package and contains only one method named compareTo(Object).
It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of single data member only.

Comparator Interface
Comparator interface is used to order the objects of a user-defined class.
This interface is found in java.util package and contains 2 methods compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
and equals(Object element).
It provides multiple sorting sequences, i.e., you can sort the elements on the basis of any data member.
