Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection, stream etc.
Java finally block is always executed whether exception is handled or not.
Java finally block follows try or catch block.
Note: If you don't handle exception, before terminating the program, JVM executes finally block(if any).
Finally block in java can be used to put "cleanup" code such as closing a file, closing connection etc.

Rule: For each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block.
Note: The finally block will not be executed if program exits(either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort).
