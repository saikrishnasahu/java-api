The Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
We can throw either checked or unchecked exception in java by throw keyword.
The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception.

The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer
to provide the exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.
Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions.
If there occurs any unchecked exception such as NullPointerException, it is programmers fault that he is not performing check up before the code being used.

Advantage of Java throws keyword
Now Checked Exception can be propagated (forwarded in call stack).
It provides information to the caller of the method about the exception.
Rule: If you are calling a method that declares an exception, you must either caught or declare the exception.
There are two cases:
Case1:You caught the exception i.e. handle the exception using try/catch.
Case2:You declare the exception i.e. specifying throws with the method.

Case1: You handle the exception
In case you handle the exception, the code will be executed fine whether exception occurs during the program or not.

Case2: You declare the exception
A)In case you declare the exception, if exception does not occur, the code will be executed fine.
B)In case you declare the exception if exception occurs, an exception will be thrown at runtime because throws does not handle the exception.
