Every Java application has a single instance of class Runtime that allows the application
to interface with the environment in which the application is running.
The current runtime can be obtained from the getRuntime method.

Methods of Java Runtime class :

public static Runtime getRuntime() : This method returns the instance or Runtime object associated with the current Java application.

public long freeMemory() : This method returns the amount of free memory in the JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

public long totalMemory() : This method returns the amount of total memory in the JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

public int availableProcessors() : This method returns the number of processors available to the JVM (Java virtual machine)

public void gc() : This method runs the garbage collector.
Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects
in order to make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
