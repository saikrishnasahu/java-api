The Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects.
It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.
Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic.

Advantage of Java Generics

Type-safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn?t allow to store other objects.
Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.
Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime.
The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.

Type Parameters
The type parameters naming conventions are important to learn. The common type parameters are as follows:
T - Type
E - Element
K - Key
N - Number
V - Value
