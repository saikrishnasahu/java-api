A class i.e. created inside a method is called local inner class in java.
If you want to invoke the methods of local inner class, you must instantiate this class inside the method.

Internal class generated by the compiler
In such case, compiler creates a class named Simple$1Local that have the reference of the outer class.
Rule: Local variable can't be private, public or protected.
