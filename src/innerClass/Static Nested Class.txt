A static class i.e. created inside a class is called static nested class in java.
It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.
It can access static data members of outer class including private.
Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method.

If you have the static member inside static nested class, you don't need to create instance of static nested class.
