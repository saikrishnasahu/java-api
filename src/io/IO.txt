Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast.
The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.
We can perform file handling in Java by Java I/O API.

Stream
A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes.
It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.
In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.
System.out: standard output stream
System.in: standard input stream
System.err: standard error stream

OutputStream vs InputStream

OutputStream
Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination;
it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
OutputStream class is an abstract class. It is the superclass of all classes representing an output stream of bytes.
An output stream accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink.

InputStream
Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
InputStream class is an abstract class. It is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes.
