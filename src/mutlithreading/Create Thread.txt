There are two ways to create a thread:

By extending Thread class
By implementing Runnable interface.

Thread class:
Thread class provide constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.
Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.

Runnable interface:
The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.
Runnable interface have only one method named run().

Starting a thread:
start() method of Thread class is used to start a newly created thread. It performs following tasks:
A new thread starts(with new callstack).
The thread moves from New state to the Runnable state.
When the thread gets a chance to execute, its target run() method will run.

If you are not extending the Thread class,your class object would not be treated as a thread object.
So you need to explicitly create Thread class object.We are passing the object of your class that implements Runnable
so that your class run() method may execute.
