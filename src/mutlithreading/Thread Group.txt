Java provides a convenient way to group multiple threads in a single object.
In such way, we can suspend, resume or interrupt group of threads by a single method call.
Note: Now suspend(), resume() and stop() methods are deprecated.
Java thread group is implemented by java.lang.ThreadGroup class.
A ThreadGroup represents a set of threads.
A thread group can also include the other thread group.
The thread group creates a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent.
A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread group,
but it cannot access the information about its thread group's parent thread group or any other thread groups.
