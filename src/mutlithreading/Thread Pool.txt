Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.
In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size threads are created.
A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider.
After completion of the job, thread is contained in the thread pool again.
