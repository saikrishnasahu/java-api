Java Networking is a concept of connecting two or more computing devices together so that we can share resources.
Java socket programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices.

Advantage of Java Networking
sharing resources
centralize software management

Java Networking Terminology
IP Address
Protocol
Port Number
MAC Address
Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol
Socket

IP Address
IP address is a unique number assigned to a node of a network e.g. 192.168.0.1 .
It is composed of octets that range from 0 to 255.
It is a logical address that can be changed.

Protocol
A protocol is a set of rules basically that is followed for communication. For example:
TCP
FTP
Telnet
SMTP
POP

Port Number
The port number is used to uniquely identify different applications.
It acts as a communication endpoint between applications.
The port number is associated with the IP address for communication between two applications.

MAC Address
MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique identifier of NIC (Network Interface Controller).
A network node can have multiple NIC but each with unique MAC.

Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol
In connection-oriented protocol, acknowledgement is sent by the receiver.
So it is reliable but slow. The example of connection-oriented protocol is TCP.
But, in connection-less protocol, acknowledgement is not sent by the receiver. So it is not reliable but fast.
The example of connection-less protocol is UDP.

Socket
A socket is an endpoint between two way communication.
