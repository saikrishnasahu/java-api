Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE.
Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.
Socket and ServerSocket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and
DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.

The client in socket programming must know two information:
IP Address of Server, and
Port number.

Here, we are going to make one-way client and server communication.
In this application, client sends a message to the server, server reads the message and prints it.
Here, two classes are being used: Socket and ServerSocket. The Socket class is used to communicate client and server.
Through this class, we can read and write message. The ServerSocket class is used at server-side.
The accept() method of ServerSocket class blocks the console until the client is connected.
After the successful connection of client, it returns the instance of Socket at server-side.
