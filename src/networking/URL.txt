The Java URL class represents an URL. URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.
It points to a resource on the World Wide Web.

A URL contains many information:
Protocol: In this case, http is the protocol.
Server name or IP Address: In this case, www.google.com is the server name.
Port Number: It is an optional attribute. If we write http//ww.google.com:80/abc/ , 80 is the port number.
If port number is not mentioned in the URL, it returns -1.
File Name or directory name: In this case, index.jsp is the file name.
