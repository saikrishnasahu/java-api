Java allows you to catch multiple type exceptions in a single catch block. It was introduced in Java 7 and helps to optimize code.
You can use vertical bar (|) to separate multiple exceptions in catch block.

In case when your are catching multiple exceptions, follow the rule of generalized to more specialized.
It means that, if you are using super (general) class, don't use child (specialized) class.
Note - Catch block which handles more than one exception type makes the catch parameter implicitly final.
