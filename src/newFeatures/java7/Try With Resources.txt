In Java, the try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources.
The resource is as an object that must be closed after finishing the program.
The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement execution.
You can pass any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable.

Suppressed Exceptions
If a try block throws an exception and one or more exceptions are thrown by the try-with-resources,
the exceptions thrown by try-with-resources are suppressed.
In other words, we can say, exceptions which are thrown by try-with-resources are suppressed exceptions.
You can get these exceptions by using the getSuppress() method of Throwable class.
Java added a new constructor and two new methods in Throwable class to deal with suppressed exceptions.
