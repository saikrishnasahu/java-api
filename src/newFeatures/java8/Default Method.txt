Java provides a facility to create default methods inside the interface.
Methods which are defined inside the interface and tagged with default are known as default methods.
These methods are non-abstract methods.

Static Methods inside Java 8 Interface
You can also define static methods inside the interface.
Static methods are used to define utility methods.

Abstract Class vs Java 8 Interface
After having default and static methods inside the interface, we think about the need of abstract class in Java.
An interface and an abstract class is almost similar except that you can create constructor in the abstract class
whereas you can't do this in interface.
