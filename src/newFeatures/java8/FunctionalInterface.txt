An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface.
It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.
It can also declare methods of object class.
Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces or SAM Interfaces.
It is a new feature in Java, which helps to achieve functional programming approach.

Invalid Functional Interface
A functional interface can extends another interface only when it does not have any abstract method.

Java Predefined-Functional Interfaces
Java provides predefined functional interfaces to deal with functional programming by using lambda and method references.
You can also define your own custom functional interface. The functional interface are placed in java.util.function package.
