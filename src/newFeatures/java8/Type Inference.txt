Type inference is a feature of Java which provides ability to compiler to look at each method invocation and
corresponding declaration to determine the type of arguments.
Java provides improved version of type inference in Java 8.
In Java 8, you can call specialized method without explicitly mentioning of type of arguments.
You can use type inference with generic classes and methods.
You can also create your own custom generic class and methods. In the following example, we are creating our own generic class and method.
